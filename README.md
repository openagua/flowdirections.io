[flowdirections.io](https://flowdirections.io) helps you delineate catchments.

# Quick start

While it is best to just play with the app to figure out how to use it, here are some tips for basic usage:

* To quickly delineate a single catchment, just click a point. That's it! Once the catchment is delineated, you may then download the catchment as a GeoJSON file.
* To delineate multiple catchments, turn off "Quick mode" under the "Home" tab, click the map where you want your outlets, then click "Delineate".
* NOTE: Click on one of the blue reference lines to properly delineate a catchment. There is currently no auto-snap feature.

# Settings

* Resolution: By default, the app uses the HydroSHEDS 15 arc-second dataset. You can change this under the "Settings" tab.
* Reference lines: Use the sliders to adjust the density and opacity of the reference lines.
* Autozoom: Turn on Autozoom to automatically zoom to generated catchments. Note that this cannot be enabled if the map's globe mode is on.

# Map settings:

* Change the base map settings--including base tiles, globe mode, and 3-D mode--by hovering over the layers icon in the lower left.
